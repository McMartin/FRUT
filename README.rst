``FRUT`` is a collection of tools dedicated to building `JUCE <https://juce.com/>`__
projects using `CMake`_ instead of `Projucer`_.

It currently contains:

- ``Reprojucer.cmake``, a CMake module that provides high-level functions to reproduce
  how a JUCE project is defined in Projucer,

- ``Jucer2Reprojucer``, a console application based on JUCE that converts ``.jucer``
  project files into ``CMakeLists.txt`` files that include and use ``Reprojucer.cmake``,

- several ``CMakeLists.txt`` files generated from existing ``.jucer`` project files,
  including:

  - ``examples`` and ``extras`` projects from `JUCE 4.2.0`_ (in `generated/JUCE-4.2.0`_)
  - ``examples`` and ``extras`` projects from `JUCE 4.3.1`_ (in `generated/JUCE-4.3.1`_)
  - ``examples`` and ``extras`` projects from `JUCE 5.0.0`_ (in `generated/JUCE-5.0.0`_)
  - ``examples`` and ``extras`` projects from `JUCE 5.2.1`_ (in `generated/JUCE-5.2.1`_)
  - ``examples`` and ``extras`` projects from `JUCE 5.3.1`_ (in `generated/JUCE-5.3.1`_)


Requirements
------------

- CMake, version 3.4 minimum
- JUCE, version 4.2.0 minimum


Supported export targets
------------------------

``Reprojucer.cmake`` and ``Jucer2Reprojucer`` support the following Projucer export
targets:

- Xcode (MacOSX)
- Visual Studio 2017
- Visual Studio 2015
- Visual Studio 2013
- Linux Makefile
- Code::Blocks (Windows)


Documentation
-------------

You can read the documentation of FRUT on Read the Docs: http://frut.readthedocs.io/


Getting started
---------------

Let's consider that you have a copy of `JUCE <https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE>`__, a
copy of `FRUT`_ and a JUCE project called ``MyGreatProject`` following this folder
structure: ::

  <root>
  ├── FRUT/
  ├── JUCE/
  └── MyGreatProject/
      ├── Source/
      └── MyGreatProject.jucer

We first build and install ``FRUT`` with CMake: ::

  $ cd <root>/FRUT/

  $ mkdir build && cd build/

  $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../prefix -DJUCE_ROOT=../../JUCE
  ...
  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done
  -- Build files have been written to: <root>/FRUT/build

  $ cmake --build . --target install
  ...

Then we convert ``MyGreatProject.jucer`` to a new ``CMakeLists.txt`` file: ::

  $ cd <root>/MyGreatProject/

  $ ../FRUT/prefix/FRUT/bin/Jucer2Reprojucer MyGreatProject.jucer ../FRUT/prefix/FRUT/cmake/Reprojucer.cmake

  <root>/MyGreatProject/CMakeLists.txt has been successfully generated.

Now we can build ``MyGreatProject`` using CMake: ::

  $ cd <root>/MyGreatProject/

  $ mkdir build && cd build/

  $ cmake .. -G<generator> -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer
  ...
  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done
  -- Build files have been written to: <root>/MyGreatProject/build

  $ cmake --build .
  ...

``<generator>`` can be one of many `CMake Generators`_ supported by your platform,
including Ninja, NMake Makefiles (on Windows), Unix Makefiles (on Linux and macOS), Visual
Studio 2013, 2015 and 2017 (on Windows), and Xcode (on macOS).

Docker
------

Build
^^^^^
To build the Docker image, run ::

  $ cd <root>/FRUT/docker
  $ docker build -t frut:latest .

This resulting image will contain ``Jucer2Reprojucer`` and ``Reprojucer.cmake`` as well as an ``entrypoint.sh`` for convenince 

Run
^^^
To convert a `.jucer` file, run ::

  $ docker run --rm -v <juce_project_directory>:/work frut /work/<juce_project>.jucer

The ``.cmake`` file will be created in the same directory as the ``.jucer`` file. 

Additionally, the Docker image can be entered for manual operation ::

  $ docker run --rm --entrypoint="" -v <juce_project_directory>:/work frut
