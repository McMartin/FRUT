jucer_project_files
===================

Register files to compile or to use as Xcode or binary resources and assign them to a
group.

::

  jucer_project_files(<group_name>
    [<compile> <xcode_resource> <binary_resource> <file_path> [<compiler_flag_scheme>]]...
  )

Use ``/`` in ``<group_name>`` to define group hierarchies. For instance, ``A/B/C`` is a
sub-group of ``A/B``.

``<compile>``, ``<xcode_resource>`` and ``<binary_resource>`` must be equal to ``x`` or
``.``, as shown in the example.

From `the AUv3Synth example of JUCE 5.2.1 <https://github.com/McMartin/FRUT/blob/main/
generated/JUCE-5.2.1/examples/AUv3Synth/CMakeLists.txt#L68-L82>`_:

.. code-block:: cmake
